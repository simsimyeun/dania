                        The Company uses a combination of industry standard security measures designed to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access. In general, your account is password-protected by the password you created when setting up the account. We recommend you secure your account by logging out after each use. In addition to your account password, the Company uses SSL encryption throughout our website, including the checkout process.
